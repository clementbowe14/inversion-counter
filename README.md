# inversion-counter
A program that counts the number of inversions in an array in n log n time

Tests are written to ensure the function properly captures:
1. All inversions exist on the left half of the array
2. All inversions exist on the right half of the array
3. Inversions are split across the left and right halves of the array

The final test reads a file containing 100000 random integers and returns the number of inversions.
